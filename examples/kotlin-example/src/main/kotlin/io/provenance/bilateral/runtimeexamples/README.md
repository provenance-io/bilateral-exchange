# Runtime Examples

This package includes various usage examples for the contract and these classes.  This is intended to show the bilateral
exchange contract working for various trade types by connecting to a real instance of the contract on the local machine.
At some point, these may be converted to integration tests of some sort.

All code execution examples are in the `examples` package, and the other sub-packages serve as helper code to make the
examples more concise in their declarations.

Various functionalities can be modified by tweaking values in the resources/local.toml file of the project.

To run an example, simply edit the `example` property in the local.toml to one of the accepted values and run the application.
